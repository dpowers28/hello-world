# hello-world
Just another repository

I am a father, husband, and a student. I am fun, exciting, and rather unpredictable. I think that the best characteristic about myself is my drive and passion towards achieving whatever I want in life. I work as an Engineering manager which is pretty cool, except that I think that I can contribute more to the world when I become an expert programmer.
